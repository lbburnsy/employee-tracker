## Deployment

## Installation
This app requires several dependencies to be installed before it will successfully run. From your command line while in the root folder of the app, run:
```
npm install
```

Following this, you will need to initialize the database required, and use the seeding data to populate it with some basic information for ease of use. To do this, simply run the commands located in [the schema.sql file.](./db/schema.sql).
